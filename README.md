# snyk-cli-yarn-patch-relative-path-bug

This repository provides a minimal example to reproduce a bug in Snyk CLI that occurs when using a relative path for Yarn patches.

Since relative paths are supported by Yarn itself, as well as generated by third-party tooling like Backstage CLI, I would expect Snyk CLI to support them as well.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `snyk monitor -d`

## Result

```
